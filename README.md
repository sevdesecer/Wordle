## Introduction

Wordle is a classic word-guessing game where players have to guess a five-letter word within a limited number of attempts. This project is a command-line version of the Wordle game, built using Python.

## How to Play

1. **Installation**

   To play the Wordle game, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Start the Game**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   python wordle.py
   ```

3. **Game Rules**

   - The game will choose a random five-letter word for you to guess.
   - You have 6 attempts to guess the word.
   - After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
     - `green word`: The letter is present in the word, and it's in the correct position.
     - `yellow word`: The letter is present in the word, but it's in the wrong position.
   - Try to guess the word using the feedback provided and make strategic guesses to narrow down the possibilities.

4. **Winning the Game**

   If you guess the word correctly within the given number of attempts, you win the game!

5. **Losing the Game**

   If you use all six attempts without guessing the word correctly, you lose the game. But don't worry; you can always try again!

Enjoy the game and happy guessing!
